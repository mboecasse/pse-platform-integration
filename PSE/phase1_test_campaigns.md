3. ‚úÖ Test UTM parameter passthrough
4. ‚úÖ Set up conversion tracking (optional for Phase 1)
5. ‚úÖ Enable auto-tagging for Google Analytics

- **Day 4**: Reduce bids -20% if CTR <2%
- **Day 5**: Increase bids +20% if PSE usage >40%
- **Day 6-7**: Prepare week 1 analysis

---

## üìä **TRACKING SETUP**

### **Google Analytics Goals** (Optional but Recommended)
Create these events as goals:
1. **PSE Loaded**: When PSE appears on page
2. **PSE Search**: When user performs search
3. **PSE Multiple Searches**: When user searches 2+ times
4. **Time on Page**: >60 seconds (engagement indicator)

### **UTM Parameter Testing**
Before launching, test each URL:

## üí° **PHASE 1 SUCCESS CRITERIA**

### **Individual Campaign Success**
‚úÖ **Winner**: ROI > 0% after 5 days
‚ö†Ô∏è **Potential**: ROI -30% to 0%, PSE usage >30%
‚ùå **Loser**: ROI < -30%, PSE usage <20%

### **Overall Success (End of Week 1)**
- At least 2 campaigns showing positive signals
- Overall PSE usage rate >30%
- Learning which keywords/pages work best
- No account warnings or policy issues

---

## üîß **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Low CTR (<1%)**
- Test different ad copy focusing on "search" and "find"
- Add more specific keywords
- Check search terms report for irrelevant queries

### **High CPC (>80% of estimate)**
- Lower bids by 20%
- Add more negative keywords
- Consider phrase match for broader reach

### **Low PSE Usage (<20%)**
- PSE placement too low on page
- PSE not loading properly
- Landing page not relevant to keyword

### **No Revenue Showing**
- Normal for first 2-3 days
- AdSense reporting delay (24-48 hours)
- Check PSE is showing ads (not just organic results)

---

**Remember**: Phase 1 is about learning, not profit. Focus on finding 2-3 keywords that show PSE revenue potential. Even -30% ROI is acceptable if PSE metrics are improving daily.
